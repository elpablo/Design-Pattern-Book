# Design Pattern Book -- Examples

This project contains some examples of Design Patterns subdivided by categories. This first verison is based on examples written in  C++.

## How to compile the C++ sources:

To compile the sources you need first the CMake tool ( that you can download from here: https://www.cmake.org/download ) which will configure the Makefile depending on your OS platform.

If you are new to CMake I suggest you to take a look at it on its documentation's pages. Otherwise, assign the sources and build directories to the CMake GUI and configure it.

Then run **make** on a terminal window on the build directory and you'll get the demo executables on each example's subdirectory.
